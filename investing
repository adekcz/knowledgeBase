from The little Book of common sense investing
by J. Boggle

- We know that we must start to invest at the earliest possible moment, and
  continue to put money away regurarly from then on.
- We know that investing entails risk. But we also know that not investing
  dooms us to financial failure.
- We know the sources of returns in stock and bond markets, and that's the
  beginning of the wisdom.
- We know that the risk of selecting specific securities, as well as the risk
  of selecting both managers and investment styles, can be eliminated by total
  diversification offered by the classsic index func. Only market risk remains.
- We know that cost matter, overpoweringly in the long run, and we know that we
  must minimize them. (We also know that taxes matter, and that they too, must
  be minimized.)
- We know that neither beating the market not sucessfully timing the market can
  be generaliyed without self-contradiction. <b>What may work for the few cannot
  work for the many</b>.
- We know that alternative asset classes such as hedge funds aren't really
  alternative, but simply pools of capital that invest-or overinvest or
  disinvest- in the very stocks and bonds that comprise the portfolio of the
  typical investor.
- Finally, we know what we don't know. We can never be certain how our world
  will look tomorrow, and we know far less about how it will look decade hence.
  But with intelligent asset allocationand sensible investment selections, you
  will be prepared for the inevitable bumps along the road and should glide
  right throught them.
